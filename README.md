### Comp 304 Operating Systems - Project 1

This is the first project of the course "Comp 304 - Operating Systems" in spring 2018 semester. 
The main part of the project requires development of an interactive Unix-style operating system shell, called shelly in C. After executing shelly, shelly will read both system and user-defined commands from the user.
